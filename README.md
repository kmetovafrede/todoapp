This is what you can do with the To-do list app:

I started by sketching out in Figma a simple layout of the window with the main layout of tasks manager.

As the next steps, I slowly implemented the main functions, so the desktop app would star functioning. 

I did not want the app to be as simple by implementing a check-boxes from python libraries, so I added icons from Nucleo.

In the final process, I changed the color of the background for more appealing look a better and I ensured that everything is working properly.

Along the way, I took notes on what should be improved in the future.
